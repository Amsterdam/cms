# Drupal with PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch
#
# This is a close copy of an example at https://hub.docker.com/_/drupal
# Differences:
#  - environment variables are defined (to be read by Drupal's settings.php)
#  - the 'sites' volume is not an anonymous volume
#  - the other volumes have been removed (as the CMS will be headless)

version: '3.5'
